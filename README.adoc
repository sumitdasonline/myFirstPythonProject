This is my first Python project


== Preparation
* Install JSON server by using the following `npm install -g json-server`

** Source Read: https://github.com/typicode/json-server

* Start the mock REST service:
** `json-server --watch planned_route.json
` -- This should default to port 3000
** `json-server --watch deliveries_for_planning.json --port 3001` -- Should change the port as default port is already in use
* Install `Python`, `PIP` and then `Request`, `jsonpath_rw`, `json`

== Test

* You can run the test by following:

** pytest -rF
